# About
Task management is an app which helps you to organize your life. It's a simple looking "To-Do" app.

# Installation
Database script is inside the "main" folder. You have to fit your database name, host and database's user information in the config file (config.php).

# App
This app is made in html, php and javascript, with design elements provided by bootstrap. 

# Functionality
Create tasks with normal or high priority (you can show that option after pressing an arrows button) as well as with a deadline date (option is hidden in the same way as priority feature). 
Delete tasks by pressing on it.
Deleted tasks are going to the "Archive" page where you can manage them with similar style as with your ongoing tasks.

# Plans for the future (from highest priorities):
- registration validation 
- email sending when deadline is getting closer
- app fully in javascript/jQuery
- better design
